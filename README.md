# wtGlobalMessage
Global Message System for [webtrees](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees) online genealogy

This module adds a notice (flash message) at each page to remind the guest-user that the displayed data is limited (if you have added some restrictions in admin panel) and that they need to log in to see more data.
